# Multilingual Keyboard - Code Organization

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase has been reorganized for better maintainability and readability:

```
lib/
├── main.dart                           # App entry point and main widget
├── models/
│   └── keyboard_layout.dart           # Keyboard layout definitions and language data
├── pages/
│   └── keyboard_demo_page.dart        # Demo page with text input area
├── services/
│   └── performance_service.dart       # Performance optimizations and reliability features
└── widgets/
    ├── keyboard_widgets.dart          # Reusable keyboard UI components
    └── minimal_exam_keyboard.dart     # Main keyboard widget with state management
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **main.dart** (24 lines)
- App initialization and configuration
- Flutter app setup with theme and routing
- Minimal entry point that delegates to pages

### **models/keyboard_layout.dart** (47 lines)
- **`KeyboardLayout`** class with static methods
- Language-specific keyboard layouts (English, Hindi, Spanish, French)
- Numeric/symbol keyboard layout
- Language name mappings

### **pages/keyboard_demo_page.dart** (95 lines)
- **`KeyboardDemoPage`** - Main demo interface
- Text input area with disabled system keyboard
- Performance metrics display
- Text input handling (backspace, character insertion)

### **services/performance_service.dart** (112 lines)
- **`PerformanceOptimizations`** - Performance-critical features
  - Keyboard pre-warming
  - Batch text operations
  - Language asset preloading
- **`ReliabilityFeatures`** - Exam-critical reliability
  - Offline operation support
  - Error recovery with retry logic
  - Memory and battery optimization

### **widgets/keyboard_widgets.dart** (172 lines)
- **`KeyboardWidgets`** - Reusable UI components
- Static methods for building keyboard elements:
  - `buildKey()` - Individual key buttons
  - `buildSpecialKey()` - Function keys (shift, backspace, etc.)
  - `buildKeyRow()` - Horizontal key rows
  - `buildBottomRow()` - Letter row with shift/backspace
  - `buildNumericBottomRow()` - Numeric row with symbols

### **widgets/minimal_exam_keyboard.dart** (329 lines)
- **`MinimalExamKeyboard`** - Main keyboard widget
- State management for:
  - Current language selection
  - Uppercase/lowercase mode
  - Numeric/letter keyboard mode
  - Language selector visibility
- Layout rendering and key press handling
- Platform channel integration (commented for demo)

## 🔧 Key Benefits of This Organization

### Separation of Concerns
- **Models**: Pure data and layout definitions
- **Services**: Business logic and platform integrations
- **Widgets**: UI components and presentation logic
- **Pages**: Screen-level composition and user interactions

### Maintainability
- Each file has a single, clear responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced coupling between components

### Testability
- Services can be tested independently
- Widget components can be tested in isolation
- Clear import structure for test files

### Scalability
- Easy to add new languages (modify `keyboard_layout.dart`)
- Easy to add new keyboard features (extend widgets)
- Easy to add new performance optimizations (extend services)

## 🚀 Usage

The keyboard maintains the same functionality as before:
- ✅ Multilingual support (English, Hindi, Spanish, French)
- ✅ Numeric/symbol keyboard mode
- ✅ Spacebar long-press for language switching
- ✅ System keyboard disabled
- ✅ Performance optimizations for exam environments

## 🧪 Testing

All imports have been updated in `test/keyboard_test.dart` to work with the new structure:

```dart
import 'package:multilingual_keyboard/widgets/minimal_exam_keyboard.dart';
import 'package:multilingual_keyboard/services/performance_service.dart';
```

Run tests with: `flutter test`
Run analysis with: `flutter analyze`

## 📈 Performance

The reorganization maintains all performance optimizations:
- Pre-loaded layouts for all languages
- Minimal widget rebuilds
- Efficient key press handling
- Battery and memory optimizations

This structure is production-ready and suitable for exam environments where reliability and performance are critical.
